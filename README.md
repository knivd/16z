The 'contemporary retro' computer

  '640K ought to be enough for anyone...'
  
Although it is known now that Bill Gates has never said that himself, whoever did, was probably right. How the resources in a system are used by the software is all that actually counts. Of course that assumes a system thought to properly utilise well written software...

Personal computing has gone a long way, but that doesn't mean it was just the right one. There is still a large number of real-life applications where an old DOS (or other similar style)-based machine works just as fine, if not even better, than the latest multicore gigahertz beast running the most recent colourful software disaster. On the way up somehow the computers have lost their way and users have lost their enthusiasm and inspiration along with that.

This project is about a computer - taking from the place where things went wrong and trying to rectify by making a retro style computer built with modern 21st century parts. Large memory and maximum speed are not aims, neither great graphics or ability to run any 'nix OS, but other things like being 'cute' (to as much as you can apply that to a board), inspiring, open and allowing easy making of user-designed add-on boards in every hobby lab.

Zilog's Z16F is a true gem amongst the dominated by Intel, ARM and MIPS today's processors. Not paticularly fast, neither exceptional with anything to mention, yet it is just something that revives that long forgotten urge to create - a processor in the real style of the 'golden age' of the personal computing.

The ultimate aim: being simple and accessible to literally everyone and to demostrate that a good usable computer does not need 'giga'-parameters. It is all matter of properly written software.

Possible applications: accounting, early programming education, data terminals, retro-style gaming, hobby design and programming.

And the most important of all - to bring some entertainment while working on it...
