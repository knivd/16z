The 'Contemporary Retro' Computer

'640K ought to be enough for anyone...'

Although it is now known that Bill Gates never actually said this, whoever did was probably not far from the truth. How the resources in a system are used by the software is what really matters. Of course, this assumes a system is properly designed to utilise well-written software.

Personal computing has come a long way, but that doesn't mean the path was always ideal. There are still numerous real-life applications where an old DOS-based (or similar) machine works just as well, if not better, than the latest multicore, gigahertz beast running the most recent colourful software disaster. Along the way, computers have somehow lost their direction, and users have lost their enthusiasm and inspiration.

This project is about a computer built in the spirit of the old ways, taking inspiration from where things went wrong and attempting to rectify it by creating a retro-style computer with modern 21st-century components. Large memory and maximum speed are not the aims, nor are great graphics or the ability to run any 'nix OS. Instead, the focus is on being 'cute' (as much as you can apply that to a board), inspiring, open, and allowing the easy creation of user-designed add-on boards in any hobby lab.

Zilog's Z16F is a true gem among today's processors, dominated by Intel, ARM, and MIPS. Although it operates at a frequency considered very low by modern standards, it is amazing due to its very clean and well-thought-out internal architecture. It is also one of the very few Von-Neumann architecture CISC processors available on the market now, making it highly suitable for early introduction into microprocessor systems design and programming. Its parameters and structure revive that long-forgotten urge to createâ€”a processor in the real style of the 'golden age' of personal computing.

The ultimate aim: to be simple and accessible to literally everyone and to demonstrate that a good, usable computer does not need 'giga'-parameters. It is all a matter of properly written software.

Possible applications: accounting, early programming education, data terminals, retro-style gaming, hobby design, and programming.

And most importantly, to bring some entertainment while working on it...
